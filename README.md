# MegaDuino 2.9

An improved versi√≥n of the initial MegaDuino project started by me on September 2019.

MegaDuino is an evolution of other projects like TZXDuino and CASduino but it's based on the Arduino Mega 2560 Pro Embed board.

MegaDuino works with my firmware MaxDuino "M" version, a modification of the MaxDuino firmware specially developed for Arduino Mega 2560 family boards,
OLED 128x64 1.3" (64 rowws) & LCD 20x4 screens, it also add an extra button for Reset or future purpouses.

It's a digital cassette tape player that allows the load of games and applications on retro computers, mainly 8-bit computers such as the
ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and others.

A special thanks to Alfredo (acf76es), without his help this update would not have been possible.

MegaDuino 2.9 has been tested on ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Oric Atmos, Dragon, Tandy Coco, Acorn Electron, BBC-Micro, ZX80 & ZX81 computers.

Board revision and notes

16-05-2020 - MegaDuino 2.9

* Reworked amplifier schema and added a DPDT slide switch to completely separate signal when the amplifier is ON or OFF.
* Reworked connections of the Audio OUT jack to allow use of stereo or mono cables without need to modify them. Also eliminates undesired signals.
* Removed extra 5v & 3.3v pins
* ICSP pins moved to a better position to allow program the Mega 2560 or use master/slave boards without opening the case.

11-04-2020 - MegaDuino 2.8

* Jumpers added to allow selection of signal gain. Now it's possible to select between 50 and 200.
