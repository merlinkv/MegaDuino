# MegaDuino 2.9

An improved versi√≥n of the initial MegaDuino project started by me on September 2019.

MegaDuino is an evolution of other projects like TZXDuino and CASduino but it's based on the Arduino Mega 2560 Pro Embed board.

It's a digital cassette tape player that allows the loading of games and applications on retro computers, mainly 8-bit computers such as the
ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and others.

A special thanks to Alfredo (acf76es), without his help this update would not have been possible.

MegaDuino 2.9 has been tested on ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Oric Atmos, Dragon & Tandy Coco computers.

I can't garantee that it works on other computers.

Board revision and notes

16-05-2020 - MegaDuino 2.9

* Reworked amplifier schema and added a DPDT slide switch to completely separate signal when th amplifier is ON or OFF.
* Reworked connections of the Audio OUT jack to allow use of stereo or mono cables without need to modify them. Also eliminates undesired signals.
* Removed extra 5v & 3.3v pins
* ICSP pins moved to a better position to allow program the Mega 2560 without opening the case.
